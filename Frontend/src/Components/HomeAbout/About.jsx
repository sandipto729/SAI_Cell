            <h3>Students’ Alumni Interaction Cell</h3>
            <p>
                It is our alumni whose significant contribution to the society has made our National Institute of Technology Durgapur (formerly, Regional Engineering College Durgapur) an institute of glory. Being a part of this glorious Institute, it becomes one of our prime duties to instil the essence of brotherhood into the minds of the alumni and their siblings from Alma-mater. We achieve this through the establishment of The NIT Durgapur Students Alumni Interaction (SAI) Cell.
            </p>
            <p>
                The SAI Cell is a group of students who voluntarily assist the functioning of the Centre for Alumni Affairs & International Relations (CAAIR). We are under the endorsement of the Dean (Alumni Affairs and Outreach). Having completely dedicated to nurturing the bond between students and alumni, the SAI Cell has become an indispensable part of the CAAIR and thus acting as a common platform for networking and interaction. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We extend our hands towards our alumni and help them reconnect to their Alma-mater. Through regular interactions with the students, the alumni get a chance to share their valuable experiences and impart the knowledge they have acquired to the next generation of NITDIANs. Also, with this interchange, they get a glimpse of the young minds of the nation. We play an instrumental role in organising the Eminent Alumni Lecture, Student-Alumni Interaction in the campus, Industry-Institute-Interaction Program, Grand Alumni Homecoming, various other reunions and publication of the Annual Yearbook. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, we look forward to offering greater assistance to both our institute and alumni through innovative programs in a brighter future. With the aim of mending the broken link between students and alumni, the Alumni Cell launched the Alumni-Student Mentorship Program with the belief that close interaction with alumni will help students gather invaluable advice regarding overall development and will also aid them in taking crucial informative life-changing decisions. We feel their valuable experience would really enrich younger minds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our team was formed with the aim to involve the students in the Alumni Activities from the student-hood itself. The team is to promote the interests of and understanding between the students of the past, present, and future NIT Durgapur through the programs and services offered by the organization. The objective is to educate the general students with a better understanding of the NIT Durgapur Alumni Network and likewise bring the alumni community up to date with the current student body. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Being students ourselves, we exactly know the flavour of being a NITDIAN and through various interactions, we assist students in having a better communication with the alumni. We help the students in sharing their college life experiences with the alumni which resonate with their experiences giving them a greater nostalgic effect. We form a part of the endeavour to promote tradition and unity within the Institute and ultimately to preserve a lifelong connection for all those who pass through the portals of NIT Durgapur.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team also tries to develop a cordial and advanced professional relationship amongst the ex-students and present students helping the novices figure out the dubious nature of the journey outside NIT Durgapur. The alumni-driven initiatives for the benefit of students, assisting Alumni in different cities and organising NITDIAN seminar, various reunions and bridging the connectivity gap between the Institute and alumni allows SAI Cell Volunteers to get a splendid view of the ‘Alumni’ world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Working for the betterment of the Institute also motivates students to understand the values created by all well-wishers of NIT Durgapur. Through the efforts of SAI Cell, alumni of REC/NIT Durgapur are now able to actively contribute towards the betterment of their Alma-mater and we feel proud to be a part of the Centre for Alumni Affairs & International Relations and witness the evolution of our National Institute of Technology Durgapur.
